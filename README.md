# ViewExtensions

A grab-bag of iOS/macOS view utilities.

These are mostly classes derived from UIView or UIViewController, or extensions on them.

If possible I prefer to have libraries that are more focussed on a specific task, but sometimes you just need a place to park some helpful general-purpose classes: right now, this is that place.

### Versioning

I'm not being strict about semantic versioning at this point; the library is too new, and things are changing too fast. 

Right now, even minor updates may break the API, and I may even move classes into more specific libraries. 

If this becomes a problem for you, please post an issue on Github, and I'll know that someone cares, at which point I'll try to take the versioning a little more seriously.
